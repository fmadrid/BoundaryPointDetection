# Boundary Point Detection from Noisy Tomographic Data (BPoint)

Our solution to the problems posed below by the Mathematical Association of America for their **PIC Mathematics** (Preparation
for Industrial Careers in Mathematical Sciences):

```
Given a randomly selected set of points from a volume, we can determine the volume assuming:
  (1) the points are equally likely to occur anywhere within the volume or 
  (2) the points are more likely to appear near the surface of the volume.
```

This solution has applicates in computed tomography. For example, when trying to identify a tumor using only tomographic point data.
