# Boundary Point Detection from Noisy Tomographic Data (BPoint)

Our solution to the problems posed below by the Mathematical Association of America for their **PIC Mathematics** (Preparation
for Industrial Careers in Mathematical Sciences):

```
Given tomographic data in the region surrounding a tumor, can we extract the volume occupied by the tumor?
```

```
Given a randomly selected set of points from a volume, how can we determine the surface enclosing 
the volume assuming the points are equally likely to occur anywhere within the volume?
```

```
Do our proposed methodologies of determining the surface change when we are more likely to detect elements of the volume 
which are nearer to the surface?
```
